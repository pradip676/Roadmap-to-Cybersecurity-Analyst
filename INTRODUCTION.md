# Introduction

The purpose of this list is to provide a pathway for beginner cybersecurity learners to access free online resources and build practical skills from the ground up. This project is designed for absolute beginners and students with no prior experience in cybersecurity, programming, or IT.

If you're interested in becoming a cybersecurity analyst but don’t know where to begin, this roadmap will guide you step-by-step. The structure is inspired by real-world analyst responsibilities and common industry learning paths.

Rather than spending time reading dozens of disconnected resources, this project helps you focus on curated material, courses, and hands-on practice. Each section of the roadmap includes topics, tools, certifications, and labs.

It is strongly recommended that you follow the order of sections — each builds upon the last. After completing a topic, apply what you learned in your home lab or practice environment.

If you face challenges, use trusted forums like Stack Overflow, TryHackMe Discord, or Reddit (r/cybersecurity) to ask for help or clarify concepts.
