# Contribution Guidelines

To maintain the quality and clarity of this learning roadmap, please follow the guidelines below when contributing:

---

## Tutorials and Resources

* Only add tutorials that are well-structured and detailed.
* Avoid overly broad tutorials that promise to "teach everything in 1 hour."
* Prefer courses with lecture-based learning, clear walkthroughs, or hands-on demonstrations.
* Use direct links to freely accessible content. Avoid content behind paywalls or registration requirements unless they’re essential and officially free (e.g., Coursera free courses).

---

## Problem Sets and Practice Labs

* Ensure that the problem set is relevant to the topic it supports.
* It should reinforce core concepts covered in the tutorials.
* Add sample input/output or expected answers when available.
* Link to hands-on labs (TryHackMe, HackTheBox, OverTheWire, etc.) when possible.

---

## Linking and Format

* Use Markdown-style formatting for headings, lists, and links.
* Link directly to `.md` files or to public sources (YouTube, GitHub, OWASP, etc.).
* Avoid duplicating content — refer to existing resources if they already exist in the repo.
